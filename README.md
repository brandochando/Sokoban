- Developed an AI-powered Sokoban solver implementing Iterative Deepening DFS, BFS, Greedy BFS, and A* to find optimal solutions.
- Designed and optimized heuristics to improve search efficiency, reducing move count by X%.
- Used priority queues and state-space search to evaluate game positions dynamically.
